# Analysis of Flight Delays

According to a study, flight delays cause approximately $40 billion loss to the United States civil aviation industry. As more and more people are opting for air travel instead of road trips to reach their destinations, it becomes imperative to maximize cost efficiency and customer satisfaction without any drop in operational efficiency. Flight delays are influenced by many events such as weather, security, airline scheduling, air traffic control, flight maintenance etc.

Data analytics can help immensely to predict flight delays and various factors making a significant contribution to those events. The objective of this project is to employ various supervised learning methods i.e., Linear Regression, Principal Component Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression which are parametric and Random Forest Regression and Support Vector Machine Regression which are nonparametric to predict the response variable Arrival Delay.

Furthermore, we used 10-Fold cross validation to validate our results. Root Mean Squared Error and RSquared are the performance metrics considered for the model comparison. Principal Component Regression is found to have the least Test Root Mean Squared Error of 7.563 and R-Squared of 0.8725.
